# I'm **Full Stack Web Developer**!

### About me

I just graduated from the **MigraCode Barcelona School**, this is a school focused on people who migrated to Europe. such as refugees, and helps them by providing them with free education thus helping them get a job and join the tech sector.

After finishing the Full Stack program, I've already started preparing myself for what I draws more my attention in this field, which is related to the **Front-End and UX/UI** of developing web applications.

At the moment, I'm following the **Google UX Design Professional Certificate** on Coursera and the **Front End Development Libraries Certification** thanks to FreeCodeCamp.org.

I have also studied **Psychology** at the **University of Lima** (Peru).

<!--
### Certificates

As part of this Full Stack certificate, I worked on different projects involving Responsive Design, Wireframing, SCRUM (Agile) Methodologies and Version Control.
